    'The rest of the deck is placed in the center and the top card of the deck is flipped over for all players to see.', 
    'If an eight is flipped over, randomly place it back inside the deck and turn over another card.\n',
    'HOW TO PLAY:',
    'The player to the left of the dealer goes first. They have the option of either drawing a card or playing a card',
    'on top of the discard pile. To play a card, the card played must either match the suit or the rank of the card shown',

    'has either drawn (at most three times) from the pile or discarded, it then becomes the next players turn.\n',
